# Troublehsooting your solutions

> ___"It doesn't work!"___

This guide covers common problems you may run into as a newcomer solving kata on Codewars, outlining common mistakes and their typical solutions. We thought it would be useful to put a lot of the common questions we see in one place!



**Scenarios:**

***


## Almost good, but...

When your solution seems to work or is close to working, but still fails tests:

* [It works at home!]()  
  On your local environment, your solution works perfectly, it but still doesn't pass the tests on codewars.

* [Only some failed tests]()  
  Everything seems correct but some tests still fail on attempt.

* [`TEST` OK, not `ATTEMPT`]()  
  When you click on `TEST` everything is good, not tests fail when hitting `ATTEMPT`, why?

* [All tests pass but last]()  
  So close! Everything passes but the very last test systematically fails. There's a problem, right?

* [I see it in the console!]()  
  When you print your answer to the console it looks exactly the same as the expected output, and yet tests fail...
  
  
  
  
## Getting information

When something goes wrong, you'd like to gather some kind of information like, what's the input? your output? what does that damn assertion message means??

* [Printing the inputs]()  
  When you're wondering what could be the input that is making your solution fail.

* [Printing doesn't work!]()  
  You want to print something to the console but nothing is showing up!

* [Confusing assertion message]()  
  When you get things like `expected {} to equal {}`...




## Something crashes

* [Execution Timeout]()  
  That works, but you're facing the damn `Execution timed out` error message.
  
* [Buffer error]()  
  That works, but you get `Max Buffer Size Reached (1.5 MiB)`

* [Exit code: number]()  
  You get this feedback, and/or a message about some strange `signal` with some number.
  
* [Nothing to STDOUT/STDERR]()  
  You get an empty output panel with `nothing was written to STDOUT or STDERR`


## Miscellaneous

* [The tests are wrong!]()  
  When you think there is a bug in the kata and/or its tests. What to do?
  
* [Talking to others]()  
  How to get you some help, to finally solve that kata.

* [Still stuck...?]()  
  You are stuck. You tried everything and nothing helped. What now?


## Appendices and other

* [Appendix A: Exit codes, signals, and other strange number...]()
